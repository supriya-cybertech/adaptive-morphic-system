# Adaptive Morphic System (AMS-01) 🌌

![AMS.01 Thumbnail](public/title-thumb.png)

## 🚀 Overview

The **Adaptive Morphic System (AMS-01)** is a cutting-edge, real-time AI-powered 3D visualization engine. It represents a fusion of **Advanced WebGL Rendering** and **Computer Vision**, creating an immersive digital organism that responds to human presence and intent.

Unlike static 3D scenes, AMS is a living particle system. It composed of **8,000+ individual glowing entities** that exhibit swarm intelligence, organic behavior, and fluid shapeshifting capabilities.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🧠 Neural Gesture Interface
Controlled via a **proprietary neural tracking layer** (powered by MediaPipe), the system detects hand landmarks in real-time with sub-millimeter precision.
- **Pinch**: Summons a **Heart** construct.
- **Open Hand**: Expands the field into a **Planetary Ring**.
- **Fist**: Compresses matter into a dense **Singularity Sphere**.
- **Explosion**: Disperses particles into a full-screen **Warp Field**.

### 2. 🧬 Organic Particle Physics
- **Living Swarm**: Particles don't just move; they *drift*. Each particle has a unique, randomized velocity profile (Drift Mode).
- **Fluid Morphing**: Transitions between shapes are non-linear and organic, eliminating robotic uniformity.
- **Singularity Core**: The default state is a centered, high-density cluster that breathes and expands like a living galaxy.

### 3. 💎 Cinematic Visuals
- **Post-Processing Bloom**: An Unreal Engine-style bloom pass creates a soft, ethereal glow.
- **Vibrant Palette**: A custom-curated gradient of **Vivid Cyan (#00FFFF)** and **Electric Blue (#0066FF)**.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: A futuristic, semi-transparent control interface that floats above the simulation.
